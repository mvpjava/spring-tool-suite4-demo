This Spring Boot Project was used to demonstrate the New features in Spring Tool Suite 4.

You can follow along the tutorial via the YouTube Video "Spring Tool Suite 4 in Docker" at https://youtu.be/do_oNrPLftg

I'll introduce you to the Eclipse based Spring Tool Suite 4 IDE running from within a Docker Container! 

In fact, all you have to do is git clone my MVP Java "docker-spring-sts4-ide" project and in 1 command, you'll be up and running - no complicated installs or extra plugins.

You'll learn the new features available in STS4 such as ...
1. Live Boot Hint Decorators
2. Hightlights CodeLens

The above two points provide runtime information in your editor - directly overlayed on your source code.
It's like a second dimension has no been introduced and you'll love it! Have you ever asked yourself the 
question "Which bean is being injected? With these new ide features, you'll know.

3. Spring specific context searching (much like 'Open Java type' but Spring specific) that allows you to quickly get an overview and navigate to the important pieces of your Spring apps. Finding 
Spring elements and navigating to them easier than ever before.

Spring Tool Suite 4 was re-built from the ground up and is lighter, more responsive and Spring aware (Spring Boot in mind). Now more IDE agnostic, you can run STS4 on Eclipse, Visual Studio Code and Atom.
